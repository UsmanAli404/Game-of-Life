# Game of Life

A dynamic and interactive implementation of Conway‚Äôs Game of Life using p5.js. This cellular automaton simulates the evolution of cell populations based on simple rules, demonstrating emergent complexity from basic principles.

## üîç Features

- **Classic Conway‚Äôs Rules**:
  - Cells live, die, or are born based on neighbor counts.
- **Interactive Drawing**:
  - Add or erase cells using mouse clicks while paused.
  - Adjustable brush size for painting multiple cells.
- **Simulation Controls**:
  - Pause and resume the simulation with spacebar.
  - Toggle between draw and erase mode with ‚ÄòE‚Äô.
  - Increase/decrease simulation speed with '+' and '-'.
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Current generation count displayed.
  - Display of mode (brush or eraser), brush size, speed, and simulation status.
- **Responsive Grid**:
  - Automatically adapts grid size based on window dimensions and cell scale.

## üïπÔ∏è Interactivity

- **Mouse Controls**:
  - Click and drag on the grid to add cells when in draw mode.
  - Click and drag to erase cells when in erase mode.
- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - `Spacebar`: Toggle pause and resume simulation.
  - `E`: Switch between draw and erase modes.
  - `+` / `-`: Increase or decrease simulation speed (frames per second).
- **Mouse Wheel**:
  - Scroll up/down to increase or decrease brush size (affects how many cells are drawn/erased at once).

## üìÅ File Structure

- `sketch.js` ‚Äì Main p5.js sketch handling setup, drawing, simulation logic, and user interaction.
- Functions for:
  - Creating and updating the grid.
  - Counting neighbors for each cell.
  - Handling input and modifying cells.
  - Displaying status and information overlays.
